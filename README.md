## Introduction
`BSTModelKit.jl` is a package for constructing, solving, and analyzing Biochemical Systems Theory (BST) models of biochemical networks written in the [Julia](https://julialang.org) programming language. In particular, `BSTModelKit.jl` provides a set of tools for constructing and solving S-system BST representations of the form:

$$
\frac{dX_{i}}{dt} = \alpha_{i}\prod_{j\in\mathcal{P}}X_{j}^{g_{ij}} - \beta_{i}\prod_{j\in\mathcal{R}}X_{j}^{h_{ij}}\qquad{i=1,\dots,n}
$$

where $X_{i}$ is the concentration of the species $i$, the values $\alpha_{i}$ and $\beta_{i}$ are kinetic parameters (rate constants), $\mathcal{P}$ is the set of species that produce $X_{i}$, $\mathcal{R}$ is the set of species that consume $X_{i}$, and $g_{ij}$ and $h_{ij}$ are the kinetic order coefficients relating species $i$ and $j$. 

The S-system BST representation was developed by [Savageau, Voit, and coworkers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Antonio_Savageau). For a nice introduction to the S-system representation of BST, see:

Finally, `BSTModelKit.jl` is a research code, expect there will be (many) bugs, breaking changes (often), etc. 

## Installation and Requirements
`BSTModelKit.jl` can be installed, updated, or removed using the [Julia package management system](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/). To access the package management interface, open the [Julia REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/), and start the package mode by pressing `]`.
While in package mode, to install `BSTModelKit.jl`, issue the command:

    (@v1.9.x) pkg> add BSTModelKit

To use `BSTModelKit.jl` in your projects, issue the command:

    julia> using BSTModelKit
